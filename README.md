# aCPSF1 dependent genome-wide transcription termination of Archaea

This code executes the analyses presented in the "aCPSF1 dependent genome-wide transcription termination of Archaea reveals an analogous eukaryotic model" manuscript.

The repository has 3 folders - script, data and result. The R code to replicate the analyses are in the script folder. The input data in the form of csv files and bed files can be found under data.

There are 3 child folders in script fold, including **differential expression analysis**( in DE_analysis ), identification of **primary transcription termination site(TTS)** (in TSS_analysis) and analysis of **polyU in other species**(in polyU_analysis).
